# Supported Units

This component is currently regularly tested against the following unit types:

* SVZ-KP30NA
* MSZ-AP50VGK
* MSZ-GL06NA
* MSZ-GE35VA
* MSZ-FS06NA

Units in the same "family" as the above (e.g. the SVZ-KP36NA) should work without issues.

Generally speaking, any Mitsubishi Electric HVAC unit that offers compatibility with Kumo Cloud will work (at least 
partially) with this project. Not all features may be available on all units.

## Unsupported Units

The following units are not supported (and likely won't be):

* Mitsubishi Ecodan Units

## Unit Not Listed?

If your unit isn't listed, don't worry. It's possible that we still support your heat pump, but we may not have been
able to test anything just yet.

If you try this library and your unit *does* work, please consider dropping your model number into 
[this GitHub Issue][report-working-unit] alongside your Extended Connect Response data from your logs. This helps us
validate hardware configurations and figure out what else exists out there.

Similarly, if you notice something not working quite right, please mention it in your post!
